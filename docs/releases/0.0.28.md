## Notes

### macOS

#### Installation

This version of ClearAligner does not include an authorized macOS developer certificate. When trying to install ClearAligner, a message like this may be displayed:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt="" width="276"><figcaption><p>macOS blocks inital ClearAligner install</p></figcaption></figure>

This can be resolved by navigating to **System Settings** > **Privacy & Security** and selecting _**Open Anyway:**_&#x20;

After doing so, the first time you open ClearAligner you will need to acknowledge one more warning, then smooth sailing is ahead:

### Windows

#### Portion of the screen not visible

Depending on the screen resolution scaling setting in Windows, a portion of the ClearAligner UI may not be immediately visible. This will be addressed in future builds. For now, users can zoom in and out using `CTRL +` or `CTRL -` to resolve the problem.
