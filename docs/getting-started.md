description: How to try ClearAligner for yourself.

# Getting Started

1. Download and install the [latest build](releases/0.0.28.md) for your operating system.
2. Follow and OS-specific installation notes on the build page.
3. Start ClearAligner.

## Use the default project for testing

ClearAligner includes a default project for testing and understanding how the tool works. On a fresh install, a project with Young's Literal Translation will be loaded and selected by default.

To test ClearAligner using this default project, navigate to the **Alignment Editor** to edit/view alignment data for a given verse reference. Alternatively, use the **Concordance View** to view existing alignment data across the entire corpus. &#x20;
