# Target Text

ClearAligner uses a simple `TSV` file format to describe tokenized texts. As of version `0.0.27`, you can import and text modeled as tabular data. The required columns are `id`, `text`, and `source_verse`.

## Example

| id | text | source\_id |
| -- | ---- | ---------- |
|    |      |            |
|    |      |            |
|    |      |            |
